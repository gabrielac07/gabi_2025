# CSP
Over the course of this year, I learned a lot. I already had a background in SQL, Python, and AWS, but I got to go deeper into it. I also learned about Javascript, which was new to me, and styling frontend. I also learned how API's worked and I learned how to build a functional website. I was able to create multiple projects, and each time I did it I improved. My first project contained no backend and I wasn't really sure how it worked. Second tri, I worked on the Bookworms project, which was a vast improvement. I learned about how deployment works and I also learned how to work with API's. Not only did I improve in programming, I also learned soft skills and what it meant to be on a team. My teamwork skills weren't as strong, but after I gained feedback, I was able to improve my communication. Overall, I learned a lot this trimester, and my personal blog reflects all the work that I've done over the years.

# Guide to my Blog
The homepage shows my personal contact information and stuff about me. Below, I've included buttons that lead to pages, and each page is organized. All my college board work is in one page, all my work for CSP including reflections and code is in another, and pages that I created at the beginning of the year about my interests are on another. These pages include buttons that take you to different things I've created. The navigation contains tools and blogs, where I've placed my documentation. 

# My favorite Project
My favorite project that I've worked on this year was Genescope. It's a website designed for people to learn about DNA and biotechnology in a fun, interactive way. It has multiple games, simulations, and quizzes that allow users to learn. It's my favorite because it works the best, and my best work is shown on there. I can see my improvement from my last project, Bookworms, and the features and capabilities I've shown on it. I also liked it because I worked on it with my team more effectively than before, and I've truly learned what it means to work together as a team.
