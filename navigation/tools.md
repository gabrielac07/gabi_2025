### Here are the steps I took to download all the tools:
- set up and install Ubuntu Linux for Windows
- install VS Code
    - I made sure to add to PATH and install "Remote Development extension pack"
- obtained the portfolio_2025 repository 
- did version checks and fixed problems that came up
- set up Github email and username to connect the commits with my Github account
- git cloned project directory and created venv
- installed requirements.txt
- used command "bundle install"
    - fixed errors that came up
- activated venv in project and opened VS Code
- used command make
    - it didn't work the first time so I had to reinstall Ruby and nbconvert

### Creating the Webpage:
- I git cloned the repository and opened it on vscode
- customized the about page 
- created this page called "tools" and added it to the navigation bar
- added mario to the home page
- created three buttons that lead to pages
- changed theme and fixed details
- went through checklist and added more hacks

### Main Difficulties:
- downloading all the right tools, especially Jupyter and Ruby
- getting the 'make' command to work
- changing and customizing the theme
