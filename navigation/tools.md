### Here are the steps I took to download all the tools:
- set up and install Ubuntu Linux for Windows
- install VS Code
    - I made sure to add to PATH and install "Remote Development extension pack"
- obtained the portfolio_2025 repository 
- did version checks and fixed problems that came up
- set up Github email and username to connect the commits with my Github account
- git cloned project directory and created venv
- installed requirements.txt
- used command "bundle install"
    - fixed errors that came up
- activated venv in project and opened VS Code
- used command make
    - it didn't work the first time so I had to reinstall Ruby and nbconvert
