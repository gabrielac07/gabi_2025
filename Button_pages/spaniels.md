## Why did I include this topic?
I have owned two of these types of dogs, and I currently have a third one named Lili.

## Fun facts about them:
- They were one of the favorite breeds of Princess Diana.
- Originally bred as hunting dogs, they excel at flushing birds, especially woodcock (hence the name "Cocker").
- They are known for their constantly wagging tails, especially when they're excited or happy.
- With webbed feet, English Cocker Spaniels are natural swimmers and love the water.
- Their floppy ears help stir up scents when they are close to the ground, making them excellent trackers.
- Cocker Spaniels are food lovers and can be prone to overeating.
